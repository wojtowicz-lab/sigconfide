        If set, run a single cheap QP solve on the original profile first and
        discard signatures whose exposure is below this value before entering
        the bootstrap loop.  Recommended value: 0.001 (zero recall loss on
        typical COSMIC data while reducing N ~4x).  Default: None (disabled).

    mandatory_indices : list of int or None
        Column indices in the original P that are treated as permanently
        active — analogous to SPA's permanent_sigs / background_sigs.
        These signatures:
          1. survive pre_filter removal,
          2. are present in the active set from the very first bootstrap
             iteration (so QP always decomposes other signatures relative
             to them), and
          3. are skipped in the backward-removal step (cannot be evicted).
        Useful for biologically ubiquitous signatures (e.g. SBS1, SBS5).
        Default: None (disabled).

    max_iterations : int
        Hard cap on the number of add/remove moves, as a last-resort guard.
        The greedy search is not monotone: on degenerate profiles (very low
        mutation counts, where bootstrap p-values are coarse) a pair of moves
        can undo each other, so the search would otherwise oscillate forever.
        Visited active sets are therefore memoised and the loop stops as soon
        as a move would revisit one; `max_iterations` only backs that up.
        Default: 1000.

    min_fit_improvement : float or None
        If set, follow the bootstrap search with a backward elimination pass
        that drops any signature whose removal costs less than this much
        reconstruction cosine.  The bootstrap criterion asks whether an exposure
        is *stable*; this one asks whether it is *needed*, which is what stops
        flat signatures from absorbing residual on deep profiles.  Mandatory
        signatures are exempt.  0.002 is the value validated on ICGC-BRCA (560
        WGS breast catalogues, COSMIC v2, Nik-Zainal Table 21 as truth): mean
        MCC 0.51 -> 0.63, SBS3 0.68 -> 0.91, and no material change at
        panel-level mutation burdens.  Default: None (disabled).

    overdispersion : float or None
        Coefficient of variation of a per-channel gamma multiplier applied to
        the profile before every bootstrap draw (see `_bootstrap_matrix`).
        The plain multinomial bootstrap has a resolution of sqrt(c) counts per
        channel, so on deep profiles any residual that a flat signature can
        absorb at more than `threshold` is "stable" and kept, whatever its
        cause; with `overdispersion` = sigma the replicates also carry a
        sigma * c component, and a signature must survive that too. 
        Default: None (plain multinomial).
